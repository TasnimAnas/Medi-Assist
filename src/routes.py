Using **OpenAI API**, the app empowers patients with knowledge and provides personalized healthcare recommendations based on the patient's age, height, weight, medical history, and current symptoms. The app also recommends which medical tests patients should undergo to confirm their diagnosis.\n\nThis platform can be used in any healthcare establishment and can be especially beneficial in remote places where people may have limited knowledge about certain medical conditions. The software can help reduce the time and cost of diagnosis, providing doctors and patients with a more efficient and effective healthcare solution. By leveraging OpenAI API, the app is able to provide very accurate and reliable recommendations, ensuring that patients receive the best possible advice for their specific needs. Our app is a required solution that helps to bridge the gap between patients and healthcare professionals, providing a valuable resource for people who may not have quick access to medical facilities or doctors.\n\nIt does not encourage patients to stop seeking medical attention and self diagnose but provides an outline of the condition that must only be treated through a physician'sÂ advice.")
